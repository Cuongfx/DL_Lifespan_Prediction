# Battery Lifespan Prediction with Custom Dense Neural Network

## Introduction
This project utilizes a custom-built Dense Neural Network to predict battery lifespan. The dataset used originates from MIT-Stanford and is available at [Matr.io](https://data.matr.io/1/). The website also provides additional details about the dataset.

The Jupyter notebooks (`file_1.ipynb`, `file_2.ipynb`, `file_3.ipynb`) contain step-by-step data extraction and preprocessing procedures. For a comprehensive explanation of the types of data used in this model, please refer to the accompanying report.

Below is a visualization of the input features used for training:
